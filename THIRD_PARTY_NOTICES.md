# Third-party notices and provenance

Original catalogue, review, campaign and semantic-retrieval scripts were developed in Dryxio's earlier GTA tooling workspace and extracted into a new repository without its history or datasets. The local TXDReader.js and ChunkType.js originated in that same author's code; they are not a copy of DragonFF. The standalone PC metadata adapter and packaging were added for this public alpha. Original code is MIT-licensed here.

Separately installed dependencies retain their own licenses:

| Dependency | Purpose | License / upstream |

| Pillow | Image evidence and contact sheets | HPND; https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow |
| NumPy | Embedding vector arithmetic | BSD-3-Clause; https://github.com/numpy/numpy |

These dependencies and model weights are not vendored. Their transitive packages retain their respective notices. Installing/copying/distributing a combined Blender/DragonFF environment requires respecting its GPL terms; this repository's MIT license does not relicense them.

The four README screenshots are renders of author-directed modding scenes created with Blender CLI and a mixture of original geometry and user-provided GTA content. Native game content visible in them belongs to its respective rights holders. The images illustrate the workflow; no game assets, game executable, annotation dataset or scene files are provided. No affiliation or endorsement is implied.
